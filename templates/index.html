    <p>I'm Kevin, I'm a web developer and I'm ok with that.</p>

    <p>
      My current language of choice is
      <a
        href="https://github.com/kevincarrogan/codebase-cli/blob/master/bin/cb"
        >Python</a
      >
      and I don't hate
      <a
        href="https://github.com/kevincarrogan/720/blob/master/static/js/main.js"
        >JavaScript</a
      >
      like a lot of people do (in fact I kind of like it but don't tell
      anyone) and dabble a little in Swift.

      <em><a href="/static/documents/kevin-carrogan-cv.pdf">undefined</a></em>
      as a software engineer {% endif %} but even in my spare time I like
      making websites and sometimes the things I make are
      <a href="http://developerarguments.com">popular</a> but a lot of the
      time they aren't, but that doesn't stop me from trying.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some of my attempts:</p>

    <ul class="list-of-links">
      {% for name, url in sites %}
      <li>
        <a href="{{url}}">{{name}}</a>
      </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <p>
      Like any good developer these days you can see how I make things on
      <a href="http://github.com/kevincarrogan">GitHub</a> including
      <a href="https://github.com/kevincarrogan/kevin.carrogan.com"
        >this website</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I choose to procrastinate I spend my time on
      <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/kevindmorgan/">Reddit</a> but I
      still don't get how an
      <a

        >inane comment</a
      >
      has gotten me the most comment karma.

      I like to code with my headphones on (but that doesn't mean I'm not
      willing to talk) and you'll mostly find me listening to
      <a
        href="http://open.spotify.com/user/kevindmorgan/playlist/6eN41BCOFkEEEM8otWSsSh"
        >Post Rock</a

    {% if letterboxd_result %}
    <p>
      Once I'm at home I like to put my feet up and watch a good movie. I most
      recently thought that
      <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Movie"
        ><a href="{{letterboxd_result.url}}" itemprop="url"
          ><span itemprop="name">{{letterboxd_result.title}}</span></a
        ></span
      >
      was {{letterboxd_result.review}}.
